"Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?"

My client was "The Gaming Room". They asked me if I could design their game named "Draw It or Lose It". Specifically, they asked if I could design this game for multiple platforms. The game is similar to a  gameshow from the 1980s called "Win, Lose, or Draw". In the game, teams compete against each other to guess what is being drawn on a screen.

"What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?"

I would say the Development Requirements chart I made that lays out how the game would fair on other platforms. It tackles concerns that will arise when thinking about developing for a specific platform.

"What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?"

While compiling all of the pros and cons of each individually platform, I found all of this helpful because I'll know what to add and what not to add dpending on the platform choice of my client.

"If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?"

I would say my Domain Model. Even though I explained it precisely within the document, I feel like I could've precisely explained it better AND make it easier to understand to people who aren't as Program-savvy.

"How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?"

When designing something for a client, you MUST consider all their needs, as you want to not only satisfy your client with a great product, but also be able to put the work on your portfolio for future clients. From what "The Game Room's" explaination, I interpreted their needs by weighing out their options of platforms to put their game on and then coming to a conclusion on what platform/platforms would be best for them.
